INSTALLATION

See the file INSTALL


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a modified version that uses PostgreSQL instead of MySQL.

The main changes are:

- The PDO connection string uses "pgsql" instead of "mysql".
- The PDO connection string uses "host=localhost". Otherwise the PostgreSQL
  client will try to authenticate with ident as the user running the web 
  server, via the unix socket, conflicting with the db_username settings.
  The db_host (in configuration/default) isn't used anywhere in the code.
- There is no REPLACE in PostgreSQL, so it was replaced with a DELETE+INSERT.
- The table and index creation file was also adapted.
